Part 1:
1. What is LibUV?
LibUV is a multi-platform support library with a focus on asynchornous I/O.
It is used for Node.js but it also used for Julia, Luvit and others.

Features
- Full-featured event loop backed by epoll, kqueue, IOCP, event ports.
- Asynchronous TCP and UDP sockets
- Asynchronous DNS resolution
- Asynchronous file and file system operations
- File system events
- ANSI escape code controlled TTY
- IPC with socket sharing, using Unix domain sockets or named pipes (Windows)
- Child processes
- Thread pool
- Signal handling
- High resolution clock
- Threading and synchronization primitives

2. Explain the difference between setImmediate(f) and setTimeout(f, Time)?
setImmediate(f):
- Executes the callback function after the current poll phase completes
- Queued in the check phase of the event loop
- Generally executes before timers if scheduled within an I/O cycle

setTimeout(f, 0):
- Schedules the callback to run after a minimum delay of 0 ms
- Actually executed after a minimum delay of 1 ms due to browser limitations
- Queued in the timers phase of the event loop

In practice, setTimeout with a 0 ms delay doesn't execute immediately. 
The execution order between these two can vary depending on the context in which they're called.

3. Explain the difference between process.nextTick(f) and setImmediate(f)?
process.nextTick(f):
- Executes the callback function at the end of the current operation, before the next event loop tick
- Has higher priority and runs before I/O events and timers
- Can cause I/O starvation if overused, as it runs before the event loop continues

setImmediate(f):
- Executes the callback function in the next iteration of the event loop
- Queued in the check phase, after I/O events
- Provides a way to execute code asynchronously, but with lower priority than nextTick

Part 2:
nextTick 1
Promise.resolve 1
Promise.resolve 2
nextTick inside Promise
this is setTimeout
this is setImmediate 1
this is setImmediate 2
Promise.resolve inside setImmediate
readablStream close event
hello
world
this is setTimeout
